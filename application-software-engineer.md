Hi ðŸ‘‹, Thank you for choosing our team.

Here are some questions to examine the basics and necessary programming knowledge, and you can answer them in any way you like (we recommend using a plain text format, such as Markdown).

In addition, please try not to use external tools during the answering process, because these questions are all derived from real work scenarios.

Ready? Then let's get started!

## Q1

What's the time complexity of the following code, and why?

```dart
int r = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (var j = i; j < N; j++) {
    r = r + 1;
  }
}
```

## Q2

Please design a series of RESTful-style APIs to implement:
- Adding product(s)
- Obtaining product information
- Updating product information
- Removing product(s)

## Q3

Consider the following Dart code, is there anything unreasonable or wrong in it? If so, how should it be modified to make it work as expected?

```dart
void main() async {
  final socket = await Socket.connect(
    /* valid ipv4 address */,
    /* valid port */
  );
  observeType1DataOf(socket);
  observeType2DataOf(socket);
}

void observeType1DataOf(Socket s) {
  s.listen((chunk) {
    print(chunk);
  });
}

void observeType2DataOf(Socket s) {
  s.listen((chunk) {
    print(chunk);
  });
}
```
## Q4

Please use Dart to implement a program that parses the following DSL and extracts valid information into memory (you can freely design the memory data structure):

```html
<Robot>
  <Model>Cartesius</Model>
  <Version>20230729</Version>
  <Build>809dxcv90j1nolqjk</Build>
</Robot>
```
